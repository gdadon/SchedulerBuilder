This is the final project as part of a computer science degree at Ariel University.

The purpose of this project is to automate the process of building a university timetable process which will be carried out automatically, which will result in relief from the Commissioner that in addition to a more comfortable teachers and students.
In the future, this system can also be used for various assignments such as assignment of work shifts, etc.
<br>At the momentthe algorithm can handle a limited number of courses and constraints.


The development process is currently underway.<br>
In the near future, the expectation is that this algorithm with few adjustments 
could be used to build a general assignments scheduler system.
